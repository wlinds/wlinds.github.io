I like to create neat utility scripts, write APIs, visualize data with plots and experiment with machine learning models using Python.\n\nI'm also maintaining <a href='https://github.com/OpenAOI/anodet'>anodet</a>, an open source convolutional neural net anomaly detection model based on ResNet and PatchCore.\n\nWhile I'm currently in favor of backend development, I do have a passion for user interface and visual design. I enjoy building mockups and wireframes, creating digital marketing material and experimenting with different web frameworks.\n\nIn 2024 I finished my studies at <a href='https://www.iths.se'>IT-HÃ¶gskolan ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</a>, where I graduated in machine learning.",

I make sure the data we feed our models is solid, reliable, and fair. Let's keep the data clean; garbage in, garbage out.",

      "description1": "Short answer: Python, JavaScript/TS, C#, SQL\n\n Long answer:\n\n<h3>Machine Learning and Data Science</h3>\nAs a developer interested machine learning, I have experience working with Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch and sklearn for building and managing machine learning models. As my work involves cleaning and processing data, Iâ€™m well-versed in data pipelines.\n\nMy data collection skills extend to web scraping with tools like Selenium and bs4. For statistical analysis I rely heavily on Pandas. When it comes to data visualization, Iâ€™m proficient with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, consistently using these libraries to create informative and appealing plots.\n\n<h3>Web Development and Engineering</h3>\nIn terms of backend development, Iâ€™ve created APIs with Flask and SQLAlchemy, and Iâ€™m comfortable managing databases with PostgreSQ, MongoDB and GraphQL. As a Data Engineer, Iâ€™ve designed and managed scalable data pipelines and infrastructure using Azure DevOps and Google BigQuery.\n\nThough my work primarily focuses on data, I also enjoy web development, where I use frameworks like Anvil, Streamlit and React+Node.js. But Iâ€™m also comfortable with the oldschool stack of JS, HTML & CSS.\n\n<h3>Frontend and Design </h3>\nIn Swedish we have this word, <em>formge</em>. (<em>form</em> = shape, <em>ge</em> = give). It roughly translates to design, but really it means to give [something] shape. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with this concept. To create something, sometimes from nothing. I apply this interest in everything from writing code, designing presentations, websites or interfaces, audio engineering and composing."
