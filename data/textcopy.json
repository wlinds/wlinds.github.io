      "description": "As of 2022 I'm studying Machine Learning & AI at <a href='test'>IT-HÃ¶gskolan</a> in Sweden. I've worked with deep learning and computer vision in anomaly detection, and I'm proficient in Azure DevOps and Azure AI Services. I like developing neat utility scripts, APIs and larger machine learning models with Python. \n\n While I'm currently in favor of backend development, I do have a passion for user interface and design. I enjoy building mockups and wireframes in Figma, creating digital marketing material and experimenting with different web frameworks.",

Whether it's avoiding bias in algorithms or being upfront about how AI decisions are made, it's all about being accountable. \n\n Then there's data integrity. Think of it as the backbone of ethical AI. I make sure the data we're feeding into these models is solid, reliable, and fair. No funky business allowed. Because if the data's messed up, well, you can bet the AI's gonna be messed up too.",

I've been creating electronic music for over 10 years and I enjoy all aspects of it, from the creative composition and chord improvisation to the mathematical signal processing and mixing techniques. \n\n The genres I'm moving between are mainly dubstep, hip hop, some drum & bass and house. I've experimented with psy-trance and lofi hip hop, produced some video game music, but really, you should check it out yourself.",

      "description1": "Short answer: Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL\n\n Long answer: Within the machine learning domain, I have hands-on experience with both Tensorflow and PyTorch, although I favor sklearn and Tensorflow with Keras for developing and managing ML models. My database experience includes postgreSQL, graphQL, and MongoDB. I've developed web APIs using Flask and SQLAlchemy. \n\n As a Data Engineer, I've constructed pipelines with Airflow. I'm used to cleaning and processing data. My data collection experience extends to web scraping, utilizing tools like Selenium and bs4. Statistically, I find Pandas and Polars invaluable for Data Science and analysis. When it comes to visualizing data, I excel with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. \n\n While my frontend skills include Anvil, React, and Node.js, my preferred framework for Data Science remains Streamlit. I have Linux knowledge and thrive in command-line environments. Additionally, I'm well-versed in version control with GIT, containerization with Docker, and deployment through Azure DevOps. AI is a domain I actively engage in, with a particular focus on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)."
