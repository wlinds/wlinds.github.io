As my work involves cleaning and processing data, I'm well-versed in data pipelines.<br><br>My data collection skills extend to web scraping with tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup. For statistical analysis I rely heavily on Pandas. When it comes to data visualization, I'm proficient with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.<br><br><h3>Web Development and Engineering</h3>In terms of backend development, I've created APIs with Flask and SQLAlchemy, and I'm comfortable managing databases with PostgreSQL, MongoDB and GraphQL. As a Data Engineer, I've designed and managed scalable data pipelines and infrastructure using Azure DevOps and Google BigQuery.<br><br>Though my work primarily focuses on data, I also enjoy web development, where I use frameworks like Anvil, Streamlit and React+Node.js. But I'm also comfortable with the oldschool stack of JS, HTML & CSS.",
